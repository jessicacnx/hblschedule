# hblschedule
Hello! This is my schedule for my hbl computing work.

I like to plan stuff in advance so this was a very fun project. 
I mainly used html and css to make the schedule.
You can see the evidence if you click on the buttons of the week you want to look at. 
When you are at the evidence pages, you can always go back using the back button at the bottom of the page.

If you click on the header, you will come to this github page!
